# No Rest For The Living
No Rest For The Living is a Minecraft mod that disables sleeping. Phantoms no longer spawn when you are sleep-deprived.
Instead, attempting to sleep will summon phantoms every 1 to 2 minutes, essentially inverting the vanilla behaviour.

If you only want to disable sleeping without triggering spawns, you can set the `doInsomnia` gamerule to false. The
`playersSleepingPercentage` gamerule becomes obsolete with this mod.
